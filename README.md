# Palladio MDSD Profiles
MDSD Profiles enable profile and stereotype support to metamodels. For this support, MDSD Profiles provide two metaclasses, ProfilableElement and StereotypableElement, from which metaclasses can inherit. ProfilableElements allow to reference a given profile; the ProfileableElement is typically the root node of a model. If such a root node accordingly references a profile, Stereotypes of the referenced profile can be applied to any StereotypableElement within that root node. Note that MDSD Profiles is based on an extension to the [EMF Profiles Project](http://www.modelversioning.org/emf-profiles).
